# Logistic Regression

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`logistic_regression.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to perform logistic regression using Python and the scikit-learn library. Logistic regression is a common machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes based on input features.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logistic-regression.git

cd logistic-regression

jupyter notebook

Open the logistic_regression.ipynb notebook in your browser.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about and run logistic regression.

## Data

The notebook uses a sample dataset (data.csv) for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own dataset or use it as a starting point for your own logistic regression projects.
